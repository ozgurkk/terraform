This terraform code provides you 4 things :
1. Ability to create a prod or nonpod  aks cluster with user pool
2. Different vm hardware profiles and node count.
3. In any case supports zone availability.
4. Adding an Azure Container Registry for the created cluster.

# Improvement required : When you run the code, there will be 2 resource  group would be created, event one of them is unnecessary. I can't fix it, yet. But I'm open to comments and your advisement.
